;
; INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATORS!
;
; 1) These files must not be saved in "Microsoft Word Format", or they will
;    be ruined. They MUST be saved in "Text Only" format.
;
; 2) Please do not insert extra blank lines, nor remove existing blank
;    lines, as this will cause the program to malfunction.
;
; 3) But it is normally okay to turn a long line into two shorter lines;
;    for instance:
;
;    This is a very long sentence; it probably won't fit on one line in German.
;
;                       is equivalent to:
;
;    This is a very long sentence; It probably
;    won't fit on one line in German.
;
; 4) It is also okay to have lines be pretty much as long as they need
;    to be off the edge of the screen (up to, say, 150-200 characters
;    long.
;
; 5) Lines beginning with "#" are control lines, and the FIRST WORD
;    immediately following the # should NOT be translated. Subsequent
;    words on the line SHOULD be translated. For example:
;
;    #caption Hello
;         to
;    #caption Bonjour
;
;    #button Yes
;         to
;    #button Oui
;
; 6) The "{" and "}" characters are used to indicate text which should
;    be displayed in BOLD type. The "[" and "]" characters indicate
;    text which should be displayed in ITALIC type. A {} sequence or
;    a [] sequence can begin and end on different lines.
;
; 7) Lines beginning with "^" begin on new lines.
;
; 8) Lines beginning with "^^" are centered.
;
; 9) The "$" character indicates a string is to be substituted. The
;    $ is followed by the name and ID of the string, as in:
;
;    Greetings, $PLAYERNAME1.
;
;    In this case, the ID of the string is 1. The name of the string
;    is for informational purposes only, so $PLAYERNAME1, $NAME1,
;    $STRING1, and $WHOZIT1 are all equivalent. The names themselves
;    do NOT need to be translated, although translating them won't
;    cause harm as long as the numerical ID is left alone (except in
;    the case below).
;
;    An important EXCEPTION is that $NUM0 (or $NUM1, $NUM2, etc)
;    indicate a numerical value is to be displayed, and $HEX0 $HEX1,
;    etc indicate a hexadecimal value will be displayed. "NUM" and
;    "HEX" must NOT be translated or their special meaning will be lost.
;
;    Other exceptions are $LINK0, $LINK1, etc., $DROPDOWN0, $DROPDOWN1, etc.,
;    $DROPLINK0, $DROPLINK1, etc. These must NOT be translated or their
;    special meaning will be lost.
;
; 10) Sequences enclosed in < > angle brackets are used to perform
;     gender and plurality substitutions.
;
;     $<...> sequences must BEGIN AND END ON THE SAME LINE!
;
;     Here are the substitution forms, followed by some examples:
;
; $FACTION3          = Substitute string 3
; $<3:has:have>      = Substitute based on plurality of string 3
; $<3:le:la:les:les> = Substitute based on plurality & gender of string 3
; $<3:masc:fem:neut:pmasc:pfem:pneut> = plurality & gender, includes neuter
; $<3:$FACTIONADJ4>  = Inserts string 4 and parses based on
;                      plurality & gender of string 3.
; $<M1:$FACTIONADJ4> = Inserts string 4 and parses for the
;                      masculine singular form.
; $<F2:$FACTIONADJ4> = ...Feminine plural, etc.
;
; Since English doesn't have the masculine/feminine
; problem, and no plural problem for "the", there will be cases where
; YOU THE TRANSLATOR will have to add sequences of this type. For
; example, you can convert the following sentences (For "faction",
; imagine substituting any of "Barbarians", "The Roman Empire", etc)
;
; The $FACTION4 $<4:has:have> ...
;
; into:
;
; $<4:Le:La:Les:Les> $FACTION4 $<4:a:ont> ...
;
; and convert...
;
; $TITLE0 $NAME1 of the $FACTION2
;
; into:
;
; $TITLE0 $NAME1 $<2:du:de la:des:des> $FACTION2
;
; Note that the "4:" or "2:" is important as it tells the computer which word
; in the sentence to take its gender/plurality from (there are often
; several substitutions in a paragraph).
;
; FRENCH translators note that the program will AUTOMATICALLY handle
; the L' and D' contractions for le, la, and de.
;
; 11. English also doesn't have adjective gender/plurality
; issues (rah rah English!) which means you'll need to correct
; those as you go along. There are two basic situations you'll
; encounter. The first is adjectives present in the text and
; used to modify words being substituted in:
;
; the pretty $ITEM3 that $NAME4 ...
;
; which you can convert to:
;
; $<3:le:la:les:les> $ITEM3 $<3:bel:belle:bels:belles> que $NAME4 ...
;
; Again the "3:" reminds the computer to substitute based on the
; plurality and gender of $ITEM3 rather than (for instance) $NAME4.
;
; The other situation you'll encounter is where an ADJECTIVE is being
; substituted in to modify words present in the text:
;
; $<M1:$FACTIONADJ0> sisters ...
;
; The "M1" calls for a masculine singular substitution (remember,
; English doesn't have this problem so I've set everything to the
; default). Obviously "sisters" is neither masculine nor singular,
; so you'll want to call for the feminine plural form:
;
; soeurs $<F2:$FACTIONADJ0> ...
;
; 12. GERMAN translators can do the same thing, and simply use
;     $<...> sequences with SIX items to take care of neuter forms.
;     Unfortunately I don't know any German at all, so I can't give
;     you any good examples.

^Hail $PLAYER0, leader of the {$STRENGTHS4} $CIVNOUN2.
Recently your people have unlocked the secrets of $TECHS3.
^ 
^{Background:} It is December, 1941. For several years the Empire of
Japan has been expanding its holdings: westward into China and, following
the fall of France in Europe, southwestward into French Indochina. To counter
Japan's aggressive moves, a coalition of western nations seeks to deny Japan
access to the rich oil and rubber resources of Malaya. Now, in late 1941,
Japan is poised to strike powerful blows against the Allied nations in order
to form and secure the "Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere".
^
^{Special:} This scenario opens with the "Japanese Empire" (Japan) already at
war against the "Allies" (a $LINK<Locked Alliance=GCON_Locked_Alliances> of America, the Commonwealth, China and the Netherlands).
^
^{Victory:} Victory is achieved by the first side to amass 40,000 VP, [or] gain
66% of the terrain [and] 46% of the population. Otherwise, the winner is the side
with the highest score at game end (February 1946; 50 turns). Coalition Victory Conditions
are in effect.
^
^{Note:} To simulate the surprise of the Japanese attack, Allied nations' units (United States,
the Commonwealth, China and the Netherlands) can't move or attack during the first
turn (December 1941). As Japan, time is [not] on your side. You must strike quickly
and decisively! Locate, capture and secure VP locations, and destroy as many Allied units
as possible. Try to avoid a long, drawn out war of attrition.
^ 
^$PLAYER0, your people have vested absolute power in you. They trust that you can
lead the $CHARLIEMYSTERY6 civilization to victory in the Pacific!
^
^{Naval Unit Designations:} Make note of the following designations used in this
scenario: CV - Aircraft Carrier; BB - Battleship; CA - Heavy Cruiser; DD - Destroyer; and
SS - Submarine.
